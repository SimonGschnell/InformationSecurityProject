--- You're ready now to build your Web Application using Java and Tomcat! ---

By using Eclipse you can...
1) create Servlets: right click on project -> New -> Servlet
	(note that Eclipse auto-generated servlets import the old 'javax' package still, replace it with 'jakarta' to work properly)
2) create HTTP/JSP/CSS/JavaScript files: right click on project -> New -> HTTP/JSP/CSS/JavaScript file
3) run your web application: right click on project -> Run As -> Run on Server -> Select the Apache Tomcat server -> Run -> Go to your browser on URL "http://localhost:8080/ExamProject/"
